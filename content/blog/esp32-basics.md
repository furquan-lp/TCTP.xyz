# ESP32 Basics

The ESP32 Board is an IoT platform based on the ESP32 family of
microcontrollers. The ESP32 series employs either a Tensilica Xtensa LX6
microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations, Xtensa LX7
dual-core microprocessor or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor and includes
built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive
amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed
by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by
TSMC using their 40 nm process. It is a successor to the
ESP8266 microcontroller.
