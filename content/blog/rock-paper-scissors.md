# Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python Using a Little Math to Make Everything Simpler

Take a look at the following piece of Python code:

```
def determine_winner(user_action, computer_action):
    if user_action == computer_action:
        print(f"Both players selected {user_action.name}. It's a tie!")
    elif user_action == Action.Rock:
        if computer_action == Action.Scissors:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
        else:
            print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user_action == Action.Paper:
        if computer_action == Action.Rock:
            print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
        else:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user_action == Action.Scissors:
        if computer_action == Action.Paper:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
        else:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")
```

This right here is a function to play a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Yes good old Rock-Paper-Scissors (which we'll discuss in a bit), a simple game and similarly simple code.

But it's not very pretty, is it? Let's make it a lot cleaner and even simpler with a little bit of math.

So let's go over Rock-Paper-Scissors again. The rules of the game are simple. Two players each simultaneously draw a hand with one of the three shapesâ€”rock, paper or scissors. The outcome of the game is then decided by which of the three shapes were drawn and how they interact.

1. Rock crushes Scissors
2. Scissors cut Paper
3. Paper covers Rock
